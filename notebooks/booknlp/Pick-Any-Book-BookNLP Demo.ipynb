    "\n",
    "[BookNLP](https://github.com/booknlp/booknlp) is a natural language processing tool developed by David Bamman. This tool can computationally identify characters, people, places, quotations, events, and  a lot more for book-length documents in English (support for other languages coming soon!). Most NLP tools do not work well on book-length documents, which makes BookNLP extremely useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Colab notebook, which is [based on a notebook](https://github.com/booknlp/booknlp/blob/main/examples/Read%20character%20file.ipynb) created by David Bamman, demonstrates how BookNLP works with a single book. The default book for this notebook is Virginia Woolf's *Mrs. Dalloway* (1925). However, you can substitue another URL in the \"Pick Your Book\" section to try BookNLP out on another book. BookNLP will take a few minutes to process a text, depending on how long it is.\n",

    "# 🚨 Before You Begin 🚨\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to sign into a Google account to use this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, BookNLP will work best if you switch to using a GPU, or Graphical Processing Unit, for this notebook. To use a GPU in Google Colab, go to the menu at the top of the screen and select:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware accelerator > GPU (Then slick \"Save\")`\n",
